#           Demonstrating how to pass variables from function to function
#           while producing a functional game.
#
#           Remember, function_name(variable) means that we pass in the variable.
#           return variable means that we are returning the variable back
#           to the calling function








def start(nice=0,mean=0,name=""):

    name = describe_game(name)
    nice,mean,name = nice_mean(nice,mean,name)












if __name__ == "__main__":
    start()
