# Tech_Academy_Python-Projects
This is a repository of my Python projects for the Tech Academy. They range from basic programs using simple python, to more complex applications using various modules, such as tkinter and sqlite3, as well as the Django framework.

## Projects:
* [Web Page Generator](https://github.com/chasetmartin/Tech_Academy_Python-Projects/tree/main/Web_Page_Generator)
* [File Transfer Program](https://github.com/chasetmartin/Tech_Academy_Python-Projects/tree/main/File_Transfer)
* [Checkbook Application](https://github.com/chasetmartin/Tech_Academy_Python-Projects/tree/main/Django_Checkbook_Project)

### Web Page Generator
A simple tkinter-based program that generates a basic HTML file for the user, and automatically launhces that page in the Chrome browser.
### File Transfer Program
The projects creates a GUI in tkinter that allows the user to transfer all files from one directory to another, with a 24 hour time filter: only files that have been edited within the past 24 hours will be moved.
### Checkbook Application
This is a fully functional Django web application that functions like a banking checkbook. With CRUD functionality it allows users to create an account, make deposits, withdrawals, and view their overall balance.
